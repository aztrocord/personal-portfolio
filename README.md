# Personal-Portfolio

[Github Repo](https://github.com/aztrocord/personal-portfolio)

This project was written by Branden Chiem, for the purpose of being used as a professional portfolio that is easily accessible to employers.

The tech stack used is HTML and CSS, and the project boasts a simple but elegantly formated header and navigation bar to personal projects, a work history and contacts page and a personal blog.

## Website Structure

The overview of the portfolio website is as shown above. The homepage of the portfolio website features a navigation bar to various parts of the project.

## Portfolio Website Wireframes

For the portfolio website, I deliberately made the conscious decision to focus on the website's accessibility. The inspiration for the interface was Spotify and Linktree, which both emphasize simplicity in color and user experience, making their respective products easy to use and understand. The main points of this design is the rounded shape of items, the navigation bar and use of "white space". I wanted to make something that would be familar to the users.

While designing the project, I came up with more detailed mockups for portfolio.

I was also inspired by LinkedIn and various resumes from people like Jake Gutierrez, who segment their skills into different categories on resume and place the skills they know in a thorough format. My reasoning for the overall design of my Portfolio Work History page is that the format of Jack's resume is commonly used in many high quality engineering resumes, and therefore is a strong choice for appealing to employers, as it has had a proven record.
