# Personal-Portfolio

[Github Repo](https://github.com/aztrocord/personal-portfolio)

This project was written for the purpose of being used as a professional portfolio that is easily accessible to employers.

The project is implemented solely with a tech stack of HTML and CSS, and the project boasts a simple but elegantly formated header and navigation bar to personal projects, a work history and contacts page and a personal blog. The design of various parts of the site is loosely inspired by LinkedIn, LinkTree and Spotify.
