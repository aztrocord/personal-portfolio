# Personal-Portfolio-Website

[Github Repo](https://github.com/duskpeyl/Personal-Portfolio-Website)

This personal portfolio website was created with the intent of serving as an easily accessible, professional showcase for prospective employers. Developed exclusively using HTML and CSS, the project features a refined, elegantly formatted header and navigation menu, leading users to pages highlighting personal projects, work history, and a personal blog.

The design of various parts of the website was loosely inspired by LinkedIn, LinkTree and Spotify.

The content of the site was written with responsive design in mind and conforms to screen sizes on mobile, tablet and desktop.
