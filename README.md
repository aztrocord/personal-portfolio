# Personal-Portfolio-Website

[Github Repo](https://github.com/duskpeyl/Personal-Portfolio-Website)

This project was written for the purpose of being used as a professional portfolio that is easily accessible to employers and was implemented solely with a tech stack of HTML and CSS.

The project boasts a simple but elegantly formatted header and navigation bar to personal projects, a work history and contacts page and a personal blog. The design of various parts of the website was loosely inspired by LinkedIn, LinkTree and Spotify.

The content of the site was written with responsive design in mind and conforms to screen sizes on mobile, tablet and desktop.
